Kruglendar 2016 — the diary poster
===

Hi there! *Kruglendar* is a minimalistic round calendar with a plenty of white space to make notes. I use it for sketching past events and planning.

*Krug* means *circle* in russian.

1. Print on А1 format
1. Put it on a wall, place a marker beside.
1. Mark the first event - kruglendar installation :)

That's how I use my circle calendar:

* Draw pictures for important events.
* Plan trips and conferences.
* If my life gets boring, I see and fix it.

In the end of the year it looks like this:

DIY tips
---
Feel free to fork and customize! Some tips may help you:

* The script resides in [/src folder](https://github.com/illus0r/kruglendar-2016/tree/gh-pages/src)
* Use the [SVG Crowbar bookmarklet](http://nytimes.github.io/svg-crowbar/) to save an `*.svg` file.
* Kruglendar uses the [Bebas Neue font family](http://www.fontfabric.com/bebas-neue/), you have to install it beforehand.
* Sometimes font size of dates renders smaller. To avoid this zoom your browser page as much as possible.
* If you want to use webfonts, you must comment a line `draw();` in code and call it later from a js console: browser needs time to load webfonts.
